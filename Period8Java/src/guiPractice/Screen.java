		 * ArrayList notes
		 * While this method is very simple, do not underestimate
		 * the trickiness of removing items in an ArrayList. 
		 * It causes indices to change:
		 * 
		 * Example: Suppose you have an ArrayList<Integer>
		 * and you want to remove all values >5
		 * THIS IS BAD:
		 * 
		 * 	for(int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {
		 * 		if(list.get(i) > 5){
		 * 			list.remove(i);
		 * 		}
		 * 	}
		 * 
		 * suppose you have (4, 5, 6, 7)
		 * The first integer to be removed is 6, at index 2
		 * since it gets removed, 7 moves from index 3 to 2.
		 * the list is now different.
		 * Also, where the for loop believes 7 is is now out of bounds
		 * 
		 * TO CORRECT THIS: decrease i when removing an item 
		 * to compensate for the change:
		 * 	for(int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {
		 * 		if(list.get(i) > 5){
		 * 			list.remove(i);
		 * 			i--;
		 * 		}
		 * 	}
