	Progress: Yep, still workin on that.
	

5/15/2017 - 5/16/2017

	Goal: Finish gathering data on courses, create tables in MAMP phpMyAdmin SQL, and import into the MAMP phpMyAdmin SQL database.
	
	Progress:
		Still in the process of creating tables and importing values.
		
		
5/17/2017

	Goal: Set up and configure MAMP server again on Computer 01
	
	To-Do:
		Will ask Mr. Goldman to have the students on Computer 01 refrain from damaging our MAMP install.
		
	Progress:
		Continued gathering data on courses. Continued designing entities for the database.

5/22/2017

	Goal: Do tables good.

		Did tables good. Considering the option of adding another column to certain COURSES tables to differentiate which particular subject the course is in (for curriculum requirement purposes, etc)

	Goal:
		Begin writing PHP scripts to use the data stored in the MySQL server.
	
		
5/24/2017

5/25/2017

	Progress:
		Began framework to determine whether the user's choice of courses satisfies their course requirements.
		Currently, the framework, written as another PHP page, receives (and returns, for debug purposes) a manipulable list of the courses selected.

	Progress:
		Created mechanism to deselect courses. 
		
		
5/31/2017

	Goal:
		Assist Alan and Javiy in creating the presentation.
		
	Progress:
		Managed to successfully perform the MySQL queries using PHP on a Windows computer. However, this computer was Anthony's personal laptop, so results may vary on the DOE computers. Will test on DOE computer tomorrow.
	
		
6/1/2017

	Goal: Attempt to get the same results as yesterday, but on a DOE computer.
	
	Progress:
		Managed to perform queries using the same technique, but the DOE computers in 5E7 are not ideal because they have both WAMPserver and MAMPserver installed, and this causes strange issues.
		
6/2/2017

	Goal: Same
		
	Progress:
		IT WORKS! (Also, must again reinstall MAMPserver due to strange phpMyAdmin screwup.)
